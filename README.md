# Hello! My name is Brendon.  üëãüèº


I am a graduate from the University of Oregon with a Bachelor's degree in Architecture, with a Minor in Business. After graduation, architectural job opportunities were not readily available, given the 2008 market crash, so I decided to change my career direction by moving into the financial industry.

I enjoyed the financial world and obtained employment with Fidelity Investments for 9 years. While employed I also obtained my Series 7, 63, & 66 licenses and worked in multiple specialty groups.

Although I enjoyed working in Finance, management and the industry itself had begun to shift in a negative direction for me.  With the Pandemic hitting all sorts of businesses and most things moving to remote jobs anyways, I once again decided to pursue a different career path and dive straight in to learning Computer Programming. I spent the entire year of 2021 immersing myself into a full-time IT coding Boot Camp called Thinkful, where I was able to gain the skills necessary to be a Full Stack Web Developer. I now can proudly state that I am a graduate!

My specialties revolve around full-stack web development, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, ReactJS, Express, Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), design principles, sketch-up, and design layouts.

A little more about me as a person. I am an Eagle Scout, a swing dance instructor, artist, have played the guitar for over 20 years, and have also lived abroad in the Philippines for 2 years, where I learned how to speak Tagalog fluently. I enjoy traveling as often as possible, camping, hiking, swimming, racquetball, astronomy, aeronautics, history and am basically the epitome of nerd when it comes to movies and cultural trivia. My goal in life is to become the best I can be and continuously work to improve myself in every area that I dedicate my time and energy to!
