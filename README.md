# Hello! My name is Brendon.  üëãüèº


I am a graduate from the University of Oregon with a Bachelor's degree in Architectural Design & Structural Engineering, with a Minor in Business. My true passion has always been in technology and artistic development with computers. With the Pandemic hitting all sorts of businesses and most things moving to remote jobs, I decided to look at this as an opportunity to learn and grow by pursuing a career path of Computer Programming. I spent the entire year of 2021 immersing myself into an IT full-time coding program through an organization called Thinkful, where I was able to gain the skills necessary to be a Full Stack Web Developer. I now can proudly state that I am a graduate!

My specialties revolve around full-stack web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Flexbox, Node.js, ReactJS, VS Code, PostgreSQL, and design layouts.

In addition to my university education, I have also obtained multiple financial licenses, while working as a professional advisor for Fidelity Investments for 9 years; including the FINRA Series 7, 63 and 66 licenses. I was recognized for top performance in superior customer relations and drove consistent lead generation for new business for multiple organizations. Having backgrounds in these subjects is only some of the many benefits I wish to bring to any organization I am employed with.
